I used SQLLite, No configuration or Authentication required.
The Migration is Automatic, I already generated a Migration Script

Note:
-I didn't bother to do Crud operations to create Tax Tables to store configuration of the Rates. I assumed that the rates are static just for the purpose of this assignement
